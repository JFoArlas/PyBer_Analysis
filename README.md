# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview
The purpose of ths analysis was to analyze rideshare data utilizing Python, Pandas, and Matplotlib and present visualizations of key metrics by city type. First I created a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by urban, suburban, & rural city types. Then, using Pandas and Matplotlib, I created a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type.

## Result
The first most apparent difference between city types is in the number of rides and drivers. There are are 13 times more rides in urban areas than there are in rural areas, and 2.6 times more than in suburban areas.

Rural cities have ~1.6 rides per driver, suburban cities have ~1.3 rides per driver, and urbancities only have .7 rides per driver. So only in urban cities are there more drivers than rides. This also makes the average fare per ride and per driver much lower in urban cities than in suburban and rural cities. That said, because there are so many more rides in urban cities, the sum of weekly fares in urban cities is still the highest.

## Summary
To address the disparities among city types, I recommend PyBer increase marketing in rural and suburban cities to gain more riders. I also recommend PyBer make driving in those cities more attractive in order to gain more drivers to ensure added demand is supported by increased supply. PyBer could also lower the fare per ride in rural and suburban cities to draw in more riders. However, if they choose to do that they should not cut driver benefits which could be counterproductive and result in unhappy drivers and potentially a loss in drivers and riders. Lastly, I reccomend digging into what caused the increase in total fares at the end of February in all three city types, as it could be something to capitalize on in future years.
